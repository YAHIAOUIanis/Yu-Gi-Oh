        <p>Yu-Gi-Oh![a] is a Japanese manga series about gaming written and illustrated by Kazuki Takahashi. It was serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump magazine between
            September 30, 1996 and March 8, 2004. The plot follows the story of a boy named Yugi Mutou, who solves the ancient Millennium Puzzle. Yugi awakens a gambling alter-ego
            within his body that solves his conflicts using various games.
            Two anime adaptations were produced; one by Toei Animation, which aired from April 4, 1998 to October 10, 1998,[2] and another produced by NAS and animated by Studio
            Gallop titled Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters, which aired between April 2000 and September 2004. The manga series has spawned a franchise that includes multiple spin-off manga
            and anime series, a trading card game, and numerous video games. Most of the incarnations of the franchise involve the fictional trading card game known as Duel Monsters,
            where each player uses cards to "duel" each other in a mock battle of fantasy "monsters". This forms the basis for the real life Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game. As of 2018,
            Yu-Gi-Oh is one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.
            In the initial planning stages of the manga, Takahashi had wanted to draw a horror manga.[5] Although the end result was a
            manga about games, it was clear that some horror elements influenced certain aspects of the story. Takahashi decided to use
            "battle" as his primary theme. Since there had been so much "fighting" manga, he found it difficult to come up with
            something original. He decided to create a fighting manga where the main character doesn't hit anybody, but also
            struggled with that limitation. When the word "game" came to mind, he found it much easier to work with.[6]</p>
